class Solution(object):

    def findComplement(self, num):
        """
        Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its
        binary representation.

        Note:
        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
