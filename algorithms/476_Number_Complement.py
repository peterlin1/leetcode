        """
        Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its
        binary representation.

        Note:
        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.


        Parameters
        ----------
        num : int


        Returns
        -------
        ret : int


        Examples
        --------
        >>> Solution().findComplement(5)
        2

        >>> Solution().findComplement(1)
        0
