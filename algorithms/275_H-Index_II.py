class Solution(object):

    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
        write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

        According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at
        least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

        Note:
        If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

        Follow up:
        This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
        Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
