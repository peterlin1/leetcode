        For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific
        rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W
        satisfy the following requirements:

        1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

        2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

        3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
        You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

        Note:
        The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
        The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
